  "description": "_**Abbey Road**_ is the eleventh studio album by the English rock band the\nBeatles. It is the last album the group started recording, although _Let It\nBe_ was the last album completed before the band's break-up in April 1970. It\nwas mostly recorded in April, July and August 1969, and was released on 26\nSeptember 1969 in the United Kingdom, and 1 October 1969 in the United States,\nreaching number one in both countries. A double A-side single from the album,\n\"Something\" / \"Come Together\" was released in October, which also topped the\ncharts in the US.\n\n_Abbey Road_ incorporates styles such as rock, pop, blues, singer-songwriter,\nand progressive rock, and makes prominent use of the Moog synthesizer and\nguitar played through a Leslie speaker unit. It is also notable for having a\nlong medley of songs on side two that have subsequently been covered as one\nsuite by other notable artists. The album was recorded in a more collegial\natmosphere than the _Get Back_ / _Let It Be_ sessions earlier in the year, but\nthere were still significant confrontations within the band, particularly over\nPaul McCartney's song \"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\", and John Lennon did not\nperform on several tracks. By the time the album was released, Lennon had left\nthe group, though this was not publicly announced until McCartney also quit\nthe following year.\n\nAlthough it was an immediate commercial success, it received mixed reviews.\nSome critics found its music inauthentic and criticised the production's\nartificial effects. By contrast, critics today view the album as one of the\nBeatles' best and rank it as one of the greatest albums of all time. George\nHarrison's two songs on the album, \"Something\" and \"Here Comes the Sun\", have\nbeen regarded as some of the best he wrote for the group. The album's cover,\nfeaturing the group walking across a zebra crossing outside Abbey Road\nStudios, has become one of the most famous and imitated in the history of\nrecorded music.",
