  "description": "_**Joker**_ is a 2019 American psychological thriller film directed by Todd\nPhillips, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Scott Silver. The film, based\non DC Comics characters, stars Joaquin Phoenix as the Joker and serves as a\nstandalone origin story for the character. Set in 1981, it follows Arthur\nFleck, a failed clown and aspiring stand-up comic whose descent into mental\nillness and nihilism inspires a violent countercultural revolution against the\nprosperous in a decaying Gotham City. Robert De Niro, Zazie Beetz and Frances\nConroy appear in supporting roles. Distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures,\n_Joker_ was produced by Warner Bros. Pictures and DC Films in association with\nVillage Roadshow Pictures, Bron Creative and Joint Effort.\n\nPhillips conceived _Joker_ in 2016 and wrote the script with Silver throughout\n2017. The two were inspired by 1970s character studies and the films of Martin\nScorsese, particularly _Taxi Driver_ (1976) and _The King of Comedy_ (1982),\nwho was initially attached to the project as a producer. The film loosely\nadapts plot elements from _Batman: The Killing Joke_ (1988), but Phillips and\nSilver otherwise did not look to specific comics for inspiration. Phoenix\nbecame attached in February 2018 and was cast that July, while the majority of\nthe cast signed on by August. Principal photography took place in New York\nCity, Jersey City and Newark, from September to December 2018. _Joker_ is the\nfirst live-action theatrical _Batman_ film to receive an R rating from the\nMotion Picture Association.\n\n _Joker_ premiered at the 76th Venice International Film Festival on August\n31, 2019, where it won the Golden Lion and was theatrically released in the\nUnited States on October 4, 2019. The film received polarizing reviews from\ncritics, with Phoenix's performance, Phillips' direction, the visual style,\nediting, musical score, and cinematography being major signs of praise, while\nthe tone, portrayal of mental illness, and handling of violence divided\nopinions. The film was a box office success and set records for an October\nrelease. It grossed over $1 billion, the first R-rated film to do so and\nbecame the sixth-highest-grossing film of 2019 during its theatrical run. The\nfilm also received numerous accolades. A musical sequel, _Joker: Folie Ã  Deux_\n, is scheduled to be released on October 4, 2024.",
