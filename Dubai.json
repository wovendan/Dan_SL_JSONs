  "description": "**Dubai** (, _doo- BY_; Arabic: دبي, romanized: _Dubayy_ , IPA: [dʊˈbajj],\nGulf Arabic pronunciation: [dəˈbaj]) is the most populous city in the United\nArab Emirates (UAE) and the capital of the Emirate of Dubai, the most\npopulated of the 7 emirates of the United Arab Emirates. Established in the\n18th century as a small fishing village, the city grew rapidly in the early\n21st century with a focus on tourism and luxury, having the second most five-\nstar hotels in the world, and the tallest building in the world, the Burj\nKhalifa, which is 828 metres (2,717 ft) tall.\n\nIn the eastern Arabian Peninsula on the coast of the Persian Gulf, it is also\na major global transport hub for passengers and cargo. Oil revenue helped\naccelerate the development of the city, which was already a major mercantile\nhub. A centre for regional and international trade since the early 20th\ncentury, Dubai's economy relies on revenues from trade, tourism, aviation,\nreal estate, and financial services. Oil production contributed less than 1\npercent of the emirate's GDP in 2018. The city has a population of around 3.49\nmillion (as of 2021).",
