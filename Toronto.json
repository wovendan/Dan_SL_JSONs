  "description": "**Toronto** ( (listen) _tə- RON-toh_; locally [təˈɹɒɾ̃ə] or [ˈtɹɒɾ̃ə]) is the\ncapital city of the Canadian province of Ontario. With a recorded population\nof 2,794,356 in 2021, it is the most populous city in Canada and the fourth\nmost populous city in North America. The city is the anchor of the Golden\nHorseshoe, an urban agglomeration of 9,765,188 people (as of 2021) surrounding\nthe western end of Lake Ontario, while the Greater Toronto Area proper had a\n2021 population of 6,712,341. Toronto is an international centre of business,\nfinance, arts, sports and culture, and is recognized as one of the most\nmulticultural and cosmopolitan cities in the world.\n\nIndigenous peoples have travelled through and inhabited the Toronto area,\nlocated on a broad sloping plateau interspersed with rivers, deep ravines, and\nurban forest, for more than 10,000 years. After the broadly disputed Toronto\nPurchase, when the Mississauga surrendered the area to the British Crown, the\nBritish established the town of York in 1793 and later designated it as the\ncapital of Upper Canada. During the War of 1812, the town was the site of the\nBattle of York and suffered heavy damage by American troops. York was renamed\nand incorporated in 1834 as the city of Toronto. It was designated as the\ncapital of the province of Ontario in 1867 during Canadian Confederation. The\ncity proper has since expanded past its original limits through both\nannexation and amalgamation to its current area of 630.2 km2 (243.3 sq mi).\n\nThe diverse population of Toronto reflects its current and historical role as\nan important destination for immigrants to Canada. More than half of residents\nwere born outside of Canada, more than half of residents belong to a visible\nminority group, and over 200 distinct ethnic origins are represented among its\ninhabitants. While the majority of Torontonians speak English as their primary\nlanguage, over 160 languages are spoken in the city. The mayor of Toronto is\nelected by direct popular vote to serve as the chief executive of the city.\nThe Toronto City Council is a unicameral legislative body, comprising 25\ncouncillors since the 2018 municipal election, representing geographical wards\nthroughout the city.\n\nToronto is a prominent centre for music, theatre, motion picture production,\nand television production, and is home to the headquarters of Canada's major\nnational broadcast networks and media outlets. Its varied cultural\ninstitutions, which include numerous museums and galleries, festivals and\npublic events, entertainment districts, national historic sites, and sports\nactivities, attract over 43 million tourists each year. Toronto is known for\nits many skyscrapers and high-rise buildings, in particular the tallest free-\nstanding structure on land outside of Asia, the CN Tower.\n\nThe city is home to the Toronto Stock Exchange, the headquarters of Canada's\nfive largest banks, and the headquarters of many large Canadian and\nmultinational corporations. Its economy is highly diversified with strengths\nin technology, design, financial services, life sciences, education, arts,\nfashion, aerospace, environmental innovation, food services, and tourism.\nToronto is the third-largest tech hub in North America after Silicon Valley\nand New York City, and the fastest growing.",
