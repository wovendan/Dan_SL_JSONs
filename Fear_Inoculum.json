  "description": "_**Fear Inoculum**_ is the fifth studio album by American rock band Tool. It\nwas released on August 30, 2019, through Tool Dissectional, Volcano\nEntertainment, and RCA Records. It is the band's first album in 13 years, due\nto creative, personal, and legal issues band members encountered since the\nrelease of _10,000 Days_. It was released to critical acclaim, with reviewers\ngenerally agreeing that the band had successfully refined their established\nsound. The album topped the US _Billboard_ 200 chart, their third in a row to\ndo so, selling over 270,000 album-equivalent units. The album topped five\nother national album charts in its opening week as well. Two songs off the\nalbum received Grammy nominations, the first single \"Fear Inoculum\", for the\nGrammy Award for Best Rock Song, and \"7empest\", for the Grammy Award for Best\nMetal Performance, with the latter winning the award. The title track also\nholds the _Guinness World Record_ for longest song ever to chart on the\n_Billboard_ Hot 100.",
